## Overview Description

**BoardGameCafé** is a social networking application designed for board games enthusiasts that provides several functionalities to learn more about your favourite games, stay up-to-date with people's opinions about them, and much more.

* **Non-registered Users** can only browse in read-only mode the contents of the application without the ability to create content.

* **Registered Users** can browse a large number of Board Games with the possibility to read their specifications,
write a review and give a rating, create posts about them and interact with other users by following them and commenting on their posts.

* **Admins** can manage Users, Board Games, Posts, Comments and Reviews with special privileges.
They also have access to the usage analytics of the application and ban users if needed: users who do not comply
with the social network rules may get *banned* by the admin.
